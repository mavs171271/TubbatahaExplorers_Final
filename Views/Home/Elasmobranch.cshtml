<p class="mb-4">
    Elasmobranchs are a subclass of cartilaginous fish that include sharks, rays, and skates. Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park is a vital habitat for many elasmobranch species due to its pristine marine environment, making it a global hotspot for marine biodiversity.

<h3 class="text-center">Common Elasmobranchs in Tubbataha Reef</h3>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h4 class="text-primary">1. Reef Sharks</h4>
    <div class="text-center mb-4">
        <img src="https://wwflac.awsassets.panda.org/img/sharks_hero_563278.jpg" alt="Reef Sharks" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" />
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>White-tip Reef Shark (Triaenodon obesus):</strong> Often found resting on the seafloor during the day, as they are nocturnal hunters.</li>
        <li><strong>Black-tip Reef Shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus):</strong> Known for their black-tipped fins, these are common in shallow reef areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Grey Reef Shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos):</strong> Found near drop-offs and coral walls, they are active and inquisitive predators.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h4 class="text-primary">2. Whale Shark (Rhincodon typus)</h4>
    <p>The largest fish in the ocean, these gentle giants feed on plankton and small fish.</p>
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h4 class="text-primary">3. Tiger Shark (Galeocerdo cuvier)</h4>
    <p>A less frequent visitor, but their presence highlights the reef's importance for larger pelagic predators.</p>
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h4 class="text-primary">4. Manta Rays</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reef Manta Ray (Mobula alfredi):</strong> Graceful swimmers often seen gliding through cleaning stations on the reef.</li>
        <li><strong>Oceanic Manta Ray (Mobula birostris):</strong> Larger than the reef manta, these rays are occasional visitors.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h4 class="text-primary">5. Eagle Rays</h4>
    <p><strong>Spotted Eagle Ray (Aetobatus narinari):</strong> Easily recognized by its spotted body and long tail.</p>
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h4 class="text-primary">6. Devil Rays and Other Mobulids</h4>
    <p>Smaller relatives of manta rays that are agile swimmers and filter feeders.</p>
</section>

<h3 class="text-center my-4">Threats to Elasmobranchs</h3>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h4 class="text-primary">1. Illegal Fishing and Shark Finning</h4>
    <p>Despite legal protections, illegal fishing remains a significant threat. Shark fins are highly valued in international markets, leading to overfishing and population declines.</p>
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h4 class="text-primary">2. Bycatch in Fisheries</h4>
    <p>Elasmobranchs are often caught unintentionally in fishing nets targeting other species. This unintentional capture, known as bycatch, can be fatal to many individuals.</p>
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h4 class="text-primary">3. Climate Change</h4>
    <p>Rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification are affecting the ecosystems that elasmobranchs rely on. Changes in food availability and habitat destruction are becoming critical challenges for their survival.</p>
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h4 class="text-primary">4. Marine Pollution</h4>
    <p>Pollution, particularly plastic waste and chemical contaminants, can disrupt the health of marine life. Elasmobranchs may ingest pollutants, leading to illness or even death.</p>
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h4 class="text-primary">5. Overfishing of Prey Species</h4>
    <p>Elasmobranchs depend on a diverse range of smaller fish and marine species as food. Overfishing depletes these prey populations, which directly impacts the food chain and the survival of elasmobranchs.</p>
</section>

<h3 class="text-center my-4">Conservation Practices to Protect Elasmobranchs</h3>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h4 class="text-primary">1. Avoid Shark Products</h4>
    <p>Do not buy products like shark fin soup, manta ray gill plates, or souvenirs made from elasmobranchs. Supporting markets that do not trade in these products helps reduce demand.</p>
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h4 class="text-primary">2. Practice Sustainable Tourism</h4>
    <p>Choose eco-certified dive operators who follow ethical practices, such as not baiting or harassing elasmobranchs. These practices help minimize human impact on these sensitive species.</p>
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h4 class="text-primary">3. Support Awareness Campaigns</h4>
    <p>Help spread information about the importance of sharks and rays in maintaining marine ecosystem balance. Participating in or supporting awareness campaigns can increase public knowledge and reduce harm to these species.</p>
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h4 class="text-primary">4. Participate in Citizen Science</h4>
    <p>Contribute to programs like shark and ray spotting surveys or photo identification efforts. These programs can help researchers track populations and monitor their health.</p>
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
    <h4 class="text-primary">5. Advocate for Stronger Protections</h4>
    <p>Support policies and legislation that aim to protect elasmobranchs. Advocate for marine protected areas, stricter regulations on fishing practices, and international cooperation to protect these species.</p>
